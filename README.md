#How to use this RAG AI Teaching assistant on your own data
## Step 0- Install requirements
Install Python packages:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need FFmpeg installed for video/audio conversion and Ollama running locally with the `bge-m3` embedding model.

## Step 1- Collect your videos
Move all your video files to the videos folder

## Step 2- Convert to mp3
Convert all the videos files to mp3 by running video_to_mp3

## Step 3- Convert mp3 to json
Convert all the mp3 files to json by running mp3_to_json

## Step 4- Convert the json files to Vectors
Use the file preprocess_json to convert the json files to a dataframe with Embeddings and save it as a joblib pickle

## Step 5- Prompt generation and feeding to LLM

Read the joblib file and load it into the memory.Then create a relevant prompt as per the user query and feed it to the LLM

## OpenAI API key
Do not paste your real key directly into code. Set it as an environment variable before running `process_incoming.py`:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
python process_incoming.py
```

For a permanent Windows user environment variable, run:

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

After using `setx`, open a new terminal before running the script.
